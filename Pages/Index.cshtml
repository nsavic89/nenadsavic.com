            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                Currently employed as ASP.NET web developer and Data Scientist
                in Switzerland. Nenad spends about half of its work time writing 
                <strong>C#</strong> code for an ASP.NET application used in clinical 
                trials. Most of his other tasks include writing of complex 
                <strong>SQL</strong> queries needed for identification of data outliers 
                and those needed for SQL Server Reporting Services.
            </p>

            <p>
                Previously, Nenad worked mostly with <strong>Python</strong> and 
                <strong>R</strong> on projects related to building solutions for 
                chemical risk assessment. The work resulted in several web tools 
                actively used world-wide by chemical industry and regulatory 
                offices. In Switzerland, this is Chemicals and Occupational 
                Health unit in the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic 
                Affairs (SECO). The tools that reached such levels of use are:
                <a href="https://trexmo.unisante.ch">TREXMO v2</a>, Taktics, 
                Ferihcs and <a href="https://www.excmotool.com">ExcmoTool</a>.
                Taktics and Ferihcs are used internally by Takeda and Ferring
                pharma companies. 
            </p>

            <p>
                On top of the mentioned computer skills, Nenad has experience
                in scientific research. In 2017, he earned a PhD degree
                from University of Lausanne. The thesis was focused on comparison
                and improvment of statisitical models that are used for 
                predicting the air concentrations of chemical contaminants 
                released in occupational activities. These regulatory models
                are those recommended by the European Chemicals Agency to
                support compliance with the REACH framework in EU. The research
                work resulted in many articles that were published in 
                international journals.
